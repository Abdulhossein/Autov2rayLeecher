# Autov2rayLeecher
## V2Ray Configuration Collector

This repository contains a Python script that collects V2Ray configuration links from specified Telegram channels, categorizes them by region based on the IP addresses contained within the links, and saves these configurations into a structured directory. Additionally, it updates a README file to include links to the saved configurations.

## Features
- Collects V2Ray configuration links from various Telegram channels.
- Categorizes configurations by region based on IP addresses.
- Saves configurations in a structured folder format.
- Automatically updates a README file with links to the saved configurations.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```
## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/V2rayConfigs.git
cd V2rayConfigs
```


2. **Run the Script**:
   Make sure you have Python installed, and then run the script:
```bash
python3 leecher.py
```


This will generate a folder named `sub` containing the V2Ray configuration files.
## Usage
Once the script has run successfully, you will find the following:
- A folder named `sub` containing region-specific folders with `config.txt` files that hold the V2Ray configurations.
- A `README.md` file that includes links to the saved configuration files.
You can use these configuration files in your V2Ray client by importing the links provided in the README.
## How It Works
1. **Collecting Links**:
   - The script fetches content from specified Telegram channels using the `requests` library.
   - It parses the HTML content using `BeautifulSoup` to extract V2Ray configuration links that start with `vless://`, `ss://`, `trojan://`, or `tuic://`.
2. **Determining Regions**:
   - For each configuration link, the script extracts the IP address and uses various APIs to determine the geographical region associated with that IP.
3. **Saving Configurations**:
   - The configurations are saved in a structured manner within the `sub` directory, categorized by region.
4. **Updating README**:
   - The script updates the `README.md` file to include links to the saved configuration files.
## Automating the Process
To automate the running of the script and uploading the generated files to GitHub, you can create a shell script (for Linux/macOS) or a batch file (for Windows). This allows you to execute the entire process with a single command.
### Example Shell Script (`automate.sh`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash

Step 1: Run the Python script
python3 leecher.py

Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
cd path/to/your/project  # Change this to your actual path

Step 3: Add the sub folder to Git
git add sub

Step 4: Commit changes
git commit -m "Update V2Ray configuration files"

Step 5: Push changes to GitHub
git push origin main  # Change 'main' to your branch name if different
```


### Example Batch File (`automate.bat` for Windows)
```batch
@echo off

REM Step 1: Run the Python script
python3 leecher.py

REM Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
cd path\to\your\project  REM Change this to your actual path

REM Step 3: Add the sub folder to Git
git add sub

REM Step 4: Commit changes
git commit -m "Update V2Ray configuration files"

REM Step 5: Push changes to GitHub
git push origin main  REM Change 'main' to your branch name if different
```
